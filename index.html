					<h2>So, why should you consider video game narratives?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>I'm going to cover:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Interactivity in games.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Increased immersion in games.</li>

				<!-- BODY -->
				<!-- SECTION ONE -->
				<section>
					<h2>Video Games Have Interactivity</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Movies and TV shows are passive experiences.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Games let you interact and contribute to the story.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Games like Until Dawn showcase this well.</p>
					<img class="r-stretch" src="https://fextralife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Until-Dawn-640x320.jpeg" alt="until dawn" />
					<aside class="notes">
						Until Dawn, a 2015 story game by Supermassive Games that highly emphasizes player choice. In it, you assume control of eight young adults who have to survive on Blackwood Mountain when their lives are threatened by various supernatural monsters.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>They emphasize branching narratives and high player involvement.</p>
					<img class="r-stretch" src="./media/ButterflyEffect.webp" alt="branch" />
					<aside class="notes">
						Until Dawn has dozens of individual choices that affect the story, including the possible death of every character.
					</aside>
				</section>


				<section>
					<p>You have to care about the story for choices to be impactful.</p>
				</section>
				<!-- SECTION 2 -->
				<section>
					<h2>Immersion</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Openness</li>
						<li>Non-linearity</li>
						<li>Self-paced</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h2>Movies are One-Dimensional</h2>
					<p>Movies and TV shows are very limited.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h2>Movies are One-Dimensional</h2>
					<p>The only experience we get is through the exact lens and camera angles shown to us.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h2>Movies are One-Dimensional</h2>
					<p>We cannot explore and discover for ourselves, we must be shown <em>every single thing</em>.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- SECTION 3 -->
				<section>
					<p>Games are much more personal.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Emotional Connection</h2>
					<p>Games put you in the character's shoes, literally.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Players can get attached to individual characters by experiencing what they do.</p>

					<h3>High emotional investment games</h3>
					<p>(Life is Strange, 2015)</p>
					<img class="r-stretch" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d3anL2iEZ1E/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="life is strange">
					<aside class="notes">
						Life is Strange is a 2015 story game centering on a character who discovers that she has the ability to rewind time at any moment. This ability is used to great effect throughout the entire story, including a part where the main character uses her ability to prevent a suicide.

					<h3>High emotional investment games</h3>
					<p>(Baldur's Gate 3, 2023)</p>
					<img class="r-stretch" src="https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2023/02/f321c065cf3f405b6d0ac06fd5a550d6a95b5a5e-scaled.jpg?resize=1088%2C612&crop_strategy=smart" alt="baldur's gate 3">
					<aside class="notes">
						A more recent example would be a game like Baldur’s Gate 3, which allows players to lead a party of characters through a Dungeons & Dragons-esque adventure. During this time, players tend to get very attached to their party members through their interactions with each other and their high-quality characterization.

					<h3>High emotional investment games</h3>
					<p>(Rimworld, 2016)</p>
					<img class="r-stretch" src="https://cdn1.epicgames.com/7051eadbb8c2435caf32a9bc0dc17936/offer/EGS_RimWorld_LudeonStudios_S1-2560x1440-410a62ec21d44260409182e1174cce2e.jpg" alt="rimworld">
					<aside class="notes">
						Rimworld is a bit different from the other games listed here, in that there isn't an inherent story. Instead, players can create their own story through their actions and in reaction to events specified by their chosen storyteller, shown here. This allows for nearly infinite possibilities.
